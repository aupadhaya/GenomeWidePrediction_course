# GWP
GENOME-WIDE PREDICTION OF COMPLEX TRAITS IN HUMANS, PLANTS AND ANIMALS

**Material for the Course "GENOME-WIDE PREDICTION OF COMPLEX TRAITS IN HUMANS, PLANTS AND ANIMALS (GWP)"**

Instructors: *Evangelina Lopez de Maturana, Oscar Gonzalez-Recio, *

This course will introduce students, researchers and professionals to the steps needed to build an analysis pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The course will describe all the necessary steps involved in a typical GWAS study, which will then be used to build a reusable and reproducible bioinformatics pipeline.

Each day the course will start at **14:00** and end at **20:00** (CET).
As a general rule, we'll have a longer break (30 minutes) at 16:00 and two shorter breaks (10-15 minutes) later on during the day (to be decided flexibly depending on the sessions).

## Organization of the Code for the practical Sessions

1. preparatory_steps: download and prepare the data
2. preprocessing: filter the data
3. imputation: imputing missing genotypes
4. gwas: run the GWAS models
5. power_and_significance: designing GWAS experiments
6. steps: identifying the individual steps involved in a GWAS study
7. pipeline: assembling the individual steps into a bioinformatics pipeline for GWAS
8. collaborative exercise: trying out what we learnt on new data
